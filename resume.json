      "summary":"Proficient and creative computer science student from the Czech Republic, yearning to do something great and meet amazing people. Currently studying at [FIT CTU, Prague](https://fit.cvut.cz/cs) in pursuit of getting a bachelor's degree in Informatics. I believe that computers should make our lives easier and I'm doing my best for this idea to come true. Automatization of processes to help people leave all that boring uncreative work to the computers is something I enjoy a lot. Skilled in creating interesting and interactive websites. Dedicated to superior customer service at all levels from the first meeting with a client to the website maintenance after launch. Detail-oriented and knowledgeable in various programming languages. The most comfortable for me is Python in the Unix ecosystem. Mainly focused on web-related solutions, finding the backend the most enjoyable. Recently started playing around with Raspberry PIs, K8S, docker, and network-related applications in general. Some of my free time goes to smart home and automatization which feels so good! Occasionally playing with my homemade clone of Prusa i3 MK2 3D printer or Arduinos. Fascinated in travelling, and photography. Chose IT in the hope not to be tightened by a fixed 9-5 schedule in an office so I can explore the beauties this wonderful planet offers, thus I'm seeking the freedom to work from wherever I want, whenever I want.",
